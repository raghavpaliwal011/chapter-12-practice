introduction to python:>
data structures:>

01-string:>
There is a function in python called print function this prints the input given by a user and this 
input is called string 
print ("hello world")-->the input here in this double quote is called string

usually to identify a string simply see that the function have " or ' if it is enclosed in these signs, 
chances are that it is a string

02-list:>
list is a collection of ordered items enclosed in square brackets like this [] this is usually used to 
represent a collection of items or only a perticular item from that whole list
for example:>

list=[1,2,3,4,"banana","apple"]
# to represent only a perticular thing we use this function
print (list[0])
print (list[2])
print (list[1])

03-tuples:>
tuples are similer to lists but the difference is that these tuples are immutable, meaning their elements
cannot be changed after creation. 
for example:>

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"banana","apple")
print (my_tuple[1])
print (len(my_tuple))

04-sets:>
sets in python are a list of unordered items usually these are used to execute mathematical programmes
for example:>

my_set={1,2,3,4,5}
my_set.add(6)#this add function will add 6
my_set.remove(1)#this remove function will remove 1
print (my_set)

05-dictionary:>
dictionary in python is a collection of unordered key value pair,usually they start with curly brackets{}
and each value in them is seperated by a colon :
here key value pair means a collection of related itmes like some dictionary will revolve around your
personal details like age , nationality , name etc.
for example:>

my_dict={"name":"raghav","age":13,"country":"india"}
print(my_dict["name"])
my_dict["age"] = 14
print (my_dict)

and yes we can later on change a value even after the creation of the dictionary as shown above

06-array:>
this means the short form of any module in python


###############################################################
in short data structures in python means different operations that we will use to store data
###############################################################

NOW THAT DATA STRUCTRUES are understood lets move on to next ones 
now some functions:>

07-def:>
def function makes the code short and reusable ,like if you want to print the sum of a and b you can
write a whole code for that or you can simply write a function named def we can perform multiple tasks
with def function and we will need to call it only once and it will return your whole code
for example:>
def calculate():
    a = 5
    b = 6

    ab = print ("the sum of a and b is :>",a+b)

calculate()

08-type:>
type function returns the type of an object
for example:>
a = int(input("enter a number = "))
print (type(a)) ------->returns <class 'int'>

09-list(), tuple(), set(), dict()
this function will change between list ,tuple, set, or dict
for example:>
#list to tuple

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print (my_tuple)

#tuple to list 

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
my_list=list(my_tuple)
print (my_list)

#list to set
my_list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
my_set = set (my_list)
print (my_list)

#creating a dictionary
my_dict = dict(name = "raghav", city = "8")
print (my_dict)
 
10-range:>
range function tells all the numbers lying between a specified range of numbers
for example:>
a = range(1,6)
print (list(a))

11-int(), float(), str():>
