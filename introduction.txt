01-string:>
There is a function in python called print function this prints the input given by a user and this 
input is called string 
print ("hello world")-->the input here in this double quote is called string

usually to identify a string simply see that the function have " or ' if it is enclosed in these signs, 
chances are that it is a string

02-list:>
list is a collection of ordered items enclosed in square brackets like this [] this is usually used to 
represent a collection of items or only a perticular item from that whole list
for example:>

list=[1,2,3,4,"banana","apple"]
# to represent only a perticular thing we use this function
print (list[0])
print (list[2])
print (list[1])

03-tuples:>
tuples are similer to lists but the difference is that these tuples are immutable, meaning their elements
cannot be changed after creation. 
for example:>

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"banana","apple")
print (my_tuple[1])
print (len(my_tuple))
