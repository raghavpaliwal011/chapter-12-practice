01-string:>
There is a function in python called print function this prints the input given by a user and this 
input is called string 
print ("hello world")-->the input here in this double quote is called string

usually to identify a string simply see that the function have " or ' if it is enclosed in these signs, 
chances are that it is a string

02-list:>
list is a collection of ordered items enclosed in square brackets like this [] this is usually used to 
represent a collection of items or only a perticular item from that whole list
for example:>

list=[1,2,3,4,"banana","apple"]
# to represent only a perticular thing we use this function
print (list[0])
print (list[2])
print (list[1])

03-tuples:>
tuples are similer to lists but the difference is that these tuples are immutable, meaning their elements
cannot be changed after creation. 
for example:>

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"banana","apple")
print (my_tuple[1])
print (len(my_tuple))

04-sets:>
sets in python are a list of unordered items usually these are used to execute mathematical programmes
for example:>

my_set={1,2,3,4,5}
my_set.add(6)#this add function will add 6
my_set.remove(1)#this remove function will remove 1
print (my_set)

05-dictionary:>
dictionary in python is a collection of unordered key value pair,usually they start with curly brackets{}
and each value in them is seperated by a colon :
here key value pair means a collection of related itmes like some dictionary will revolve around your
personal details like age , nationality , name etc.
for example:>

my_dict={"name":"raghav","age":13,"country":"india"}
print(my_dict["name"])
my_dict["age"] = 14
print (my_dict)

and yes we can later on change a value even after the creation of the dictionary as shown above

06-array:>
this means the short form of any module in python
